# DATASET DESCRIPTION

-> The Airbnb recommendation dataset is a collection of data related to Airbnb listings and their corresponding booking information. It contains information such as the listing ID, the host ID, the listing's geographical location (latitude and longitude), the listing's description, the amenities available, the price per night, and the availability calendar.

-> Additionally, the dataset contains booking information, such as the dates of the booking, the number of guests, and the price paid for the booking. It also includes reviews and ratings provided by previous guests, including the date of the review, the reviewer's ID, and the content of the review.

-> The dataset can be used for various purposes, such as predicting the popularity of a listing based on its features, analyzing the impact of reviews and ratings on booking rates, or identifying the most common amenities that guests look for in a listing. It is publicly available and has been used in numerous research studies in the fields of machine learning and data mining.
