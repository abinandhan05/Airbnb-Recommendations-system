# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The advanced algorithm used by Airbnb's recommendation system matches visitors with the most appropriate properties. The technology examines different aspects such as location, amenities, price, reviews, and user preferences to deliver customised recommendations.

-> The recommendation mechanism on Airbnb includes the following main components:

-> Personalization: To make personalised recommendations, Airbnb's recommendation engine considers a user's search history, previous reservations, and reviews.

-> Machine learning: To evaluate massive volumes of data and find patterns that can be utilised to generate precise suggestions, the system employs machine learning algorithms.

-> Airbnb's recommendation algorithm employs collaborative filtering methods to suggest listings that are comparable to those that the user has previously liked or reserved.

-> The engine also employs content-based filtering to suggest postings that are comparable in terms of setting, amenities, cost, and other attributes.
